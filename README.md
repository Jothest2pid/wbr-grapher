# WhatBeatsRock Save Grapher

WhatBeatsRock Save Grapher is a tool designed to visualize and analyze save data from the WhatBeatsRock game. The tool also allows merging multiple save files for later use in the grapher. This project is entirely open-source and licensed under the MIT License.

## Features

- **Save Visualization:** Graphically visualize your saves copied straight from WhatBeatsRock.
- **Save Merging:** Merge multiple save files into a single text file that can later be loaded and visualized using the grapher.
- **WhatBeatsRock Loader Integration:** Works seamlessly with the [WhatBeatsRock Save Loader Userscript](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/508318-whatbeatsrock-save-loader) created by JoTheStupid.

## How to Use

### 1. Visualizing Saves

Simply copy your WhatBeatsRock save (The thing at the bottom of your WBR page, ex. flood ðŸ¤œ lava ðŸ¤œ rock) into the Bulk Input text box, and click Process Bulk Input.

### 2. Merging Save Files

By processing multiple bulk inputs the loader merges saves, meanin your text file save output will have all the saves you inputted into it!

### 3. Sync with Save Loader Userscript

The WhatBeatsRock Save Grapher is fully compatible with the [WhatBeatsRock Save Loader Userscript](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/508318-whatbeatsrock-save-loader). The loader userscript uses the saves from the loader, allowing you to pick from all your saves which you want to load and load it.
